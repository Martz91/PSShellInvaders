## PowerShell Invaders

This is a small PowerShell-based version of Space Invaders. Itâ€™s a fun little experiment on making an interactive game within the console without using `System.Drawing` or `System.Windows.Forms`.  
The very basic mechanics of the game work as expected, even though playing it will not entertain you for long.
